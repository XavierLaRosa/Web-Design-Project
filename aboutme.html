					People tend to think that I am 100% hispanic; however, I am half Peruvian and half Filipino and 
					a small percentage of Chinese! My mother was born and raised in Manila, 
					Philippines and my father was born in Lima, Peru. They eventually met in New Jersey when they 
					immigrated and had me as their second child! I was raised in Trenton, New Jersey for a few years, and
					 spent 2 years in the Philippines.

					I also love video games. I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember starting with the nintendo 64 and the PS2.
				    For the past few months, I have been playing Rainbow 
					Six Siege with my three friends and it's a blast. I'm more into games with either a great story or a game that is meant to be played with friends.

					Video games kind of led me into majoring in Computer Science because it made me realize I have a great interest in technology. I want to always learn more and more about technology so that I may apply it in the real world. The web design, video game developement, and mobile app design fields are all very intriguing. Either way, they take a lot of work and collective thinking but working in a team and striving for the same success inspires me
					to hopefully one day be in that industry.

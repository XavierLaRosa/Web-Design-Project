# Web-Design-Project
This is my web design project from 2016 using HTML/CSS skills.
- Download the zip file and you will find a collection of files
- There are JPG and JPEG files
- There are HTML files
- There is a CSS file which is the dominating template for all web pages of the project
- Run the "home.html" file to launch the web site project

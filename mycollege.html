						<dt class="description">My College Career</dt>
							<dd><p>
							I decided to go to college and spefically to 
							CCM in the fall semester of 2015
							to get an extremely affordable education. 
							This is my first year and so far it has a been 
							challenging yet successful. I 
							am majoring in Computer Science because 
							I've always liked the idea about designing 
							your own application or program. It involves 
							an extensive amount of logical and creative 
							thinking. I plan to finish my associates 
							degree within 2 years and then hopefully go to 
							NJIT or Rutgers NewBrunswick or Rutgers Newark.
